User ID

# Analysis Steps
Data Loading: The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.
Data Cleaning: Missing values, duplicates, and outliers are addressed to ensure data quality.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Descriptive statistics, visualizations, and correlation analysis are performed to gain insights into the dataset.
Sales Trends: We examine sales trends during the Diwali festival period, including popular product categories and customer preferences.
